setuptools-gitmodules
=====================

This is a setuptools extension that manages install dependencies through git
submodules.  The idea is to have first-party dependencies as git submodules and
to use them as editable installation for developers, and to list them as install
dependencies in the format "pkgname==x.y.z" when building a binary distribution.

Limitation
----------

- Requires first-party dependencies to be uploaded to pypi
  This was the reason this setuptools extension was built in the first place.
  If you can ship the deps bundled with the top-level package, then you don't
  need this extension.

Development Status
------------------

TODO
----

- [x] Find the setuptools entrypoint
- [x] Use the entrypoint to dynamically add to install dependencies
- [ ] Parse .gitmodules file and generate install dependencies string
